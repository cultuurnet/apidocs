# Introduction

This space gives an overview of the possible authentication methods on publiq's APIs.

In the past, almost every one of our APIs used a different authentication method. To provide a consistent experience and reduce the work needed to integrate with multiple of our APIs, we have evolved our APIs to support a shared authentication approach.

To start, you will need a set of client credentials consisting of a **client id** and **client secret** which we will provide you. You can then use these in 3 ways to authenticate your requests to our APIs, depending on the API(s) you integrate with and your function use case. See the [authentication methods overview](./methods.md) for more info about the various ways that you can authenticate your requests.

To request your own set of client credentials, see [requesting client credentials](./requesting-credentials.md).
