# Requesting client credentials

## UiTPAS API & UiTdatabank APIs
Before you can start making authenticated API requests to UiTPAS and/or UiTdatabank, you need to register your integration on our self-service platform [publiq platform](https://platform.publiq.be). In the registration process you'll need to pick the API you want to use:
* [UiTPAS API](https://docs.publiq.be/docs/uitpas/introduction)
* [UiTdatabank Entry API](https://docs.publiq.be/docs/uitdatabank/entry-api/introduction)
* [UiTdatabank Search API](https://docs.publiq.be/docs/uitdatabank/search-api/introduction)

Note that the UiTPAS API will also grant you access to the UiTdatabank Entry API. 

Registration and access to our test environment is free. After registration you'll immediately get your test credentials.

## museumPASSmusées Partner API

The [museumPASSmusées Partner API](https://docs.publiq.be/docs/museumpassmusees/introduction) is currently not included on our self-service platforma, as it is only provided to very specific partners for now as the primary use case at the moment is registering museum visits via a card reader. To request your credentials, please contact <support@museumpassmusees.be>.
