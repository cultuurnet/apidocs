Welcome to the museumPASSmusées API documentation!

## Partner API

With the museumPASSmusées Partner API you can look up the card of a passholder and check if they are allowed to visit your museum and register their visit so your museum gets reimbursed for it.

It also enables you to sell museumPASSmusées subscriptions to new passholders by generating voucher codes and selling those to new passholders to use in the online order process on [museumpassmusees.be](https://museumpassmusees.be).
