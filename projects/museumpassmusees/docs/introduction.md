Welcome to the museumPASSmusées API documentation!

## Partner API

With the museumPASSmusées Partner API you can look up the card of a passholder and check if they are allowed to visit your museum and register their visit so your museum gets reimbursed for it. *(Coming soon)*

It also enables you to sell museumPASSmusées subscriptions to new passholders by generating voucher codes and selling those to new passholders to use in the online order process on [museumpassmusees.be](https://museumpassmusees.be).
