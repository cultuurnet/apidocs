# Authentication

To use the museumPASSmusées Partner API, you will need a **client id** and **client secret** to retrieve a [client access token](https://docs.publiq.be/docs/authentication/4706c3721316a-client-access-token) to authenticate your requests.

To call an endpoint, your client also needs specific permissions linked to a role.

We distinguish 2 roles:

* **Visit registrar**: a museum partner that is allowed to scan cards, verify passholder identity and register visits for these passholders
* **Voucher generator**: a partner that is allowed to resell museumPASSmusées voucher codes

Client credentials for the museumPASSmusées Partner API are only provided to specific partners. To request your credentials, please contact <support@museumpassmusees.be>.
