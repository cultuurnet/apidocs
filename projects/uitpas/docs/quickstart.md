# Getting started

On this page we outline the basic steps to integrate your application with UiTPAS.

> There are a few requirements that must be met to go live. Make sure you read this guide before you start developing on our test environment.

## 1. Start on the test environment

Create an integration on publiq platform, our self-service portal to request your credentials for the UiTPAS testing environment.

[![Add your entry API integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cultuurnet/apidocs/main/assets/add-your-integration.svg)](https://platform.publiq.be)

Within a few days you'll receive an email with a confirmation, giving you access to the [test organizer](./test-dataset.md). Note that your new client will only be active after you receive the UiTPAS confirmation email.

## 2. Dive in the docs

Carefully read [the authentication guide](./authentication.md) and get a grasp of common UiTPAS [terminology](./terminology.md).

## 3. Start building

Start building your application on the UiTPAS testing environment with the [test organizer](./test-dataset.md).

> Make use of our step-by-step guides for common integration scenarios such as [How to register discounted ticket sales](./registering-ticket-sales.md) and [How to pay with UiTPAS-points](./pay-with-UiTPAS-points.md).

## 4. Switch to the production environment

Ready for production? To ensure the quality of applications built with the UiTPAS-API, there is a one-time manual approval. **Plan a short demo of your application by contacting <technical-support@publiq.be>.** After we approve your application, you will receive your production credentials.
