# Quick start

**These are the basic steps to integrate your application with UiTPAS:**

1. **[Create an integration via platform.publiq.be](https://platform.publiq.be)** to request your credentials for the UiTPAS testing environment. Within a few days you'll receive an email with a confirmation, giving you access to the [test organizer](./test-dataset.md) **(note: your new client will only be active after you receive the UiTPAS confirmation email)**

2. Carefully read [the authentication guide](./authentication.md) and get a grasp of common UiTPAS [terminology](./terminology.md).

3. **Start building your application on the UiTPAS testing environment with the [test organizer](./test-dataset.md).**

   Make use of our step-by-step guides for common integration scenarios
   such as [How to register discounted ticket sales](./registering-ticket-sales.md) and [How to pay with UiTPAS-points](./pay-with-UiTPAS-points.md).

4. **Ready for production?**  To ensure the quality of applications built with the UiTPAS-API, there is a one-time manual approval. **Plan a short demo of your application by contacting technical-support@publiq.be.** After we approve your application, you will receive your production credentials.
