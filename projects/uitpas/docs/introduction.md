## What is UiTPAS?

UiTPAS is a loyalty card for cultural, sports, and pastime events in Flanders and Brussels. More than 470.000 passholders can save points by attending events and trade them for rewards.

Next to rewards, passholders in need can receive a social tariff ('kansentarief') on UiTPAS events. Those discounts are payed for via a third-party payer system in which the organizer of the event, the local government and the passholder each pay a percentage of the ticket price.

## About our API

Check out our [development quick start guide](https://docs.publiq.be/docs/uitpas/getting-started) to get up and running.

The UiTPAS API follows the [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) principles. Our APIs have predictable resource-oriented URLs, accept and return [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)-encoded data, and use standard HTTP methods, status codes and [authentication](./authentication.md)).

In our documentation you will find:

* Explanations of relevant UiTPAS terminology and concepts
* Step-by-step guides to common UiTPAS integration scenarios
* Code examples, so you can see how the APIs works in practice
* Detailed technical specifications per HTTP endpoint
* OpenAPI files and Postman collections to get started quickly
* [Release notes](https://docs.publiq.be/docs/release-notes/introduction) to keep up-to-date with recent changes in our API
