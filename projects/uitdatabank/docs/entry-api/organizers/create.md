  @todo
  - Mention that you must always reuse an existing organizer when possible and link to that guide.
  - Focus on creating a simple organizer with just the required properties here.
  - Explain that you can also supply optional properties and give examples
  - Link to some other guides as next steps (for example "Updating an organizer", ...)
