# Linking an organizers

## Permissions

Anyone can link any organizer if they have the permission to [update the event](../events/update.md) or [update the place](../places/update.md) they want to link to the organizer. This does not mean that people who work at the organizer get permission to edit your event or place.

## Overview

You can link an organizer to your event or place via the organizer endpoint [`PUT /events/{eventId}/organizer`](/reference/entry.json/paths/~1events~1{eventId}~1organizer/put)

<!-- 
  @todo
  - Explain who can link which organizers to events/places (= anyone can link any organizer to their own events/places) 
  - Explain that the linked organizer does NOT give permission to people that work at that organisation to make edits to the event
  - Explain how to link
  - Link to guides about finding organizers & creating organizers for info how to get an organizer URI
