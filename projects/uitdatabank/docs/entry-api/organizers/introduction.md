# What are organizers?

Organizers in UiTdatabank represent organisations or persons that organize [events](../events/introduction.md) or manage [places](../places/introduction.md).

Possible types of organizers are sociocultural associations, historical associations, non-profits, individuals like musicians or actors, and so on.

In some cases, the location and organizer of an event can overlap. For example the concert hall [Het Depot](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Het_Depot_\(muziekcentrum\)) is managed by a non-profit with the same name, that organizes events at that location. In that case it is advised to create both a [place](../places/introduction.md) for the location and a separate organizer for the non-profit that organizes the events.

Every organizer is required to have at least a name, and a unique website URL to avoid duplicates. Read also our guide on [finding and re-using existing organizers](finding-and-reusing-organizers.md) before creating a new organizer.
