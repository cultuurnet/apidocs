<!-- 
  @todo 
  Explain to upload the image first (link to that guide), then demonstrate how to add the uploaded image/"mediaObject" to an event/place/organizer and optionally set it as the main image.
  Explain that you can do it both when creating/updating an event/place/organizer, or using the separate endpoint(s).
