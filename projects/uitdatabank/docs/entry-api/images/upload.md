Coming soon.

<!-- 
  @todo 
  Give more context and example POST /images endpoint (with form-data) 
  Preferably also a PHP and JS example and not just curl
  Make sure to mention that the "file" field must contain binary data, and cannot contain a URL of a remote file. Also when using curl in PHP, you cannot set it to a remote URL. You need to download it yourself first.
