# Entry API

With Entry API, you can register cultural and leisure events organized by your organisation or your customers in UiTdatabank free of charge, giving them exposure on [UiTinVlaanderen](https://www.uitinvlaanderen.be) and more than 500 online and printed calendars run by local or national media, authorities and organisations.

If you only organize a handful of events per year however, we advice to enter them manually via the user-friendly interface at <https://www.uitdatabank.be> instead.

Aside from events, Entry API also makes it possible to manage locations where event are happening or that can be visited (e.g. museums) and the organisations that organize them.
