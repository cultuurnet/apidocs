# What are places?

Places in UiTdatabank represent locations that an [event](../events/introduction.md) is happening at like concert halls and theaters. They can also be places like monuments, museums and libraries which are related to culture or leisure and can be visited by the public.

The latter kind of places are also published on [UiTinVlaanderen](https://www.uitinvlaanderen.be) and over a thousand other calendars, just like events.

In some cases a place can serve both as a location for events, as well as a location for visits.

Examples of places that serve as locations for events:

* "Het Depot", a concert hall in Leuven
* "De Munt", an opera hall in Brussels
* "De Kraakfabriek" in Antwerp where you can play several escape room games
* The fashion museum "MoMu" in Antwerp where you can book guided tours and other activities

Examples of places that are published on UiTinVlaanderen and other calendars to visit:

* The fashion museum "MoMu" in Antwerp where you can visit the exhibitions at regular opening hours
* A park or forest where you can make walks, mountainbike, ...
* A playground where children can go to play
* A monument open for visits at regular opening hours
