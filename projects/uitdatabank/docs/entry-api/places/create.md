Coming soon.

<!--
  @todo
  - Mention that you must always reuse an existing place when possible and link to that guide.
  - Permissions: Who can create places?
  - Focus on creating a simple place with just the required properties here.
  - Start from a super simple example with calendarType permanent and an example eventtype.
  - Explain further down what the different calendarTypes are (permanent/periodic + openingHours), and how to find other eventtypes.
  - Explain that you can also supply optional properties (e.g. description, ...).
  - Link to some other guides as next steps (for example "Updating a place", "Publishing a place", ...)
