# Sharing ticket/reservation availability

> Albeit possible in practice for a place to be sold out for a certain moment/day, we do not currently support this in our API. Places in UiTdatabank do not have granular time information and therefore do not allow to indicate a certain moment as fully booked or sold out. As a result, the top-level bookingAvailability for places is always `Available`.
