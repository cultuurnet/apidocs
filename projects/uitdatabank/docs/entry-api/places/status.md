Coming soon.

<!-- 
  @todo 
  Explain how to mark a place as (temporarily) closed, and optionally add a reason.
  Maybe show screenshot(s) of how (temporarily) closed places look on UiTinVlaanderen (as an example).
  Also mention that when the place re-opens, the status should be changed to reflect this (instead of creating a new place, as opposed to postponed events).
