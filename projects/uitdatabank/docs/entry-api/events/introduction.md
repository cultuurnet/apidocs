# What are events?

Events in UiTdatabank represent cultural, leisure and sport-related activities happening in Flanders, Brussels, and in some cases the rest of Europe.

Events can be temporary in time, permanent or periodic with a recurring schedule, or on request. They are required to have a [location](../places/introduction.md). [Events bookable by schools](create-school.md) and [online events](create-online.md) also require a location for backward compatibility with older integrations, but use a hardcoded one.

Examples include:

* The short film festival happening from December 1st to December 8th in Cinema ZED.
* Admiral Freebee performing on November 30th in the Monty in Antwerp.
* The Christmas market on the Grote Markt in Brussels from November 30th to December 30th.
* Guided tours in M HKA and the Middelheimmuseum, every day (except Mondays) between 10am and 5pm.

Events stored in UiTdatabank are published on [UiTinVlaanderen](https://www.uitinvlaanderen.be) and over a thousand other [online calendars](../../terminology.md#online-calendar) and offline publications, which gives them more exposure so interested audiences can more easily find and attend them.

To ensure a qualitative dataset, not every kind of activity is allowed. Read the guidelines in our helpdesk article ["Welke activiteiten mag ik invoeren in UiTdatabank"](https://helpdesk.publiq.be/hc/nl/articles/360008702459-Welke-activiteiten-mag-ik-invoeren-in-UiTdatabank-) (Dutch) for more info.
