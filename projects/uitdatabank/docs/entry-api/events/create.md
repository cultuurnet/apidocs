Coming soon.

<!--
  @todo
  - Focus on creating a simple event with just the required properties here.
  - Start from a super simple example with calendarType single and an example location and eventtype.
  - Explain further down what the different calendarTypes are, and how to find other existing locations and eventtypes.
  - Explain that you can also supply optional properties (e.g. description, theme, ...). Also link to the "requirements before going live" for an overview of important optional properties.
  - Link to some other guides as next steps (for example "Updating an event", "Publishing an event", ...)
