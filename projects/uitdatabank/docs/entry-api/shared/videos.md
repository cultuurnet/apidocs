# Videos

Videos make your events or places stand out from the crowd and more attractive to visitors.

Online calendars can show an embedded video player, so results with videos are more likely to be checked out by visitors.

In this guide you will learn how to add videos to your events and places. Additionally, you'll learn how to update or remove the videos afterward.

## Scope

Videos can be uploaded and linked to:

* ✅ [Events](../events/introduction.md)
* ✅ [Places](../places/introduction.md)
* ❌ [Organizers](../organizers/introduction.md)
