Coming soon.

<!--
  @todo
  - Give more context and example POST /images endpoint (with form-data) 
  - Preferably also a PHP and JS example and not just curl
  - Make sure to mention that the "file" field must contain binary data, and cannot contain a URL of a remote file. Also when using curl in PHP, you cannot set it to a remote URL. You need to download it yourself first.
  - Demonstrate how to add the uploaded image/"mediaObject" to an event/place/organizer and optionally set it as the main image. Explain that you can do it both when creating/updating an event/place/organizer, or using the separate endpoint(s).
  - Permissions: Who can upload images?
  - Explain/demonstrate how to delete an image from an event/place/organizer.
  - Explain that you cannot delete the image/mediaObject itself.
