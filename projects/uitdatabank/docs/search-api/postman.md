# Postman collection

We provide a Postman collection that is automatically generated using the OpenAPI documentation for UiTdatabank's Search API. 

Click the button below to go the download page, where you can optionally also enter your client id so the authentication configuration of the collection is automatically pre-filled. Note that the Search API requires no client secret so you may leave that field empty in the download form.
