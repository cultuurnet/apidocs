# Search API

With Search API you can query all the events, places and organizers stored inside UiTdatabank. This allows you to, for example, build an online calendar targeted to a specific audience on your own website. Our very own [UiTinVlaanderen](https://www.uitinvlaanderen.be) is also powered by Search API under the hood.

By integrating directly with Search API in your website you remain in full control of every aspect of the integration. A notable example of this is [UiTinLeuven](https://www.uitinleuven.be).

However, the development costs can also be high. If you have a limited budget or are lacking the technical know-how to build an API integration you can use our configurable [Widgets](https://docs.publiq.be/docs/widgets) instead to embed an online calendar on your website. These widgets use the exact same Search API underneath but are pre-built by publiq and ready to use on any website. Notable examples of this are [UiTinGent](https://www.uitingent.be), [INTER](https://www.vlaanderen.be/inter/meedoen-aan-een-toegankelijke-samenleving/agenda-toegankelijke-evenementen) and [Indiestyle](https://www.indiestyle.be/agenda).
