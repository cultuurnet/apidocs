    calendarType
    dateFrom
    dateTo
    localTimeFrom
    localTimeTo
    availableFrom (mention default filter on this and link to that guide)
    availableTo (mention default filter on this and link to that guide)
    Explain how range queries on range fields (dateRange / availableRange) work (any overlap is a match, but you can explicitly exclude anything that falls outside of your range in an advanced query).
