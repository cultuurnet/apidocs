### Political events

* ❌ Activities that exclusively express one political opinion (e.g. a speech).
* ✅ Activities involving more than one political party or opinion, or where no political position is taken and the leisure content prevails (e.g. a debate or dinner party).

### Religious activities

* ❌  Activities aimed exclusively at propagating or professing a religion or cult, or aimed at a community of believers or adherents (e.g. weekly Eucharist).
* ✅  Activities that are rooted in religion, but are publicly accessible and where the leisure aspect prevails. Examples: a procession, a performance in a synagogue, or a tour of a mosque.

### Objects and websites

### Activities where money and opportunity are central

* ✅ An exception to this are bookable school events solely targeted towards schools, and can be booked by a teacher or school for educational purposes.
