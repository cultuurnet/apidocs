# Configuration

Now that you have picked a [template](./template.md) for your widget, you can start adding rows and configuring each block inside the template individually. 

## Rows

A row is a group of columns that are on the same horizontal line. A row can contain one, two or three columns. In each of those columns, you can add one or more blocks. 

> In the [agenda](./getting-started#agenda), [tips](./getting-started#tips) and [UiTPAS en Paspartoe ](./getting-started#uitpas) template, the rows and blocks are already been prepared for you. 

There are five types of rows:
1. **Volledige paginabreedte**: the row contains one column
2. **Twee kolommen met een zijbalk links**: the row contains two columns, of which the right one is twice as wide as the left one
3. **Twee kolommen met een zijbalk rechts**: the row contains two columns, of which the left one is twice as wide as the right one
4. **Drie kolommen met een dubbele zijbalk**: the row contains three columns, of which the one in the center twice as wide as the right and left one
5. **Drie gelijke kolommen**: the row contains three columns of equal width

## Blocks

There are five different types of blocks:
1. **Zoekbox**: with a search box you add a search form that surfers can use you search activitities. 
2. **Zoekresultaten**: with a search result block you add a list of activities. In this block you determine which events are displayed in the widget agenda, and which information is shown about the events (location, date & time, price information, etc.). This block also contains the setting for the detail page of an event.
3. **Tips**:: with a tips block you can highlight certain events. 
3. **Verfijningen**: with a facet block a surfer can filter the search result list.
4. **HTML**: with a HTML block you can add HTML content yourself to the widget page. You can do this by the means of a HTML editor or by writing HTML yourself.

Each block can be added multiple times. However, for the sake of a smooth user experience we recommend to use only one block 

### Moving blocks

You can move blocks around with the drag and drop icon in the top left corner of each block. You can move a block 
* to another place inside the same row
* to another row
