# Introduction

Handling errors is an important part of every API integration.

While errors can be frustrating, we aim to make them as easy as possible to fix by using the same error format on every API and by including as much detail as possible in the error response.

This space provides technical info and examples for the format of error responses on all of publiq's APIs, as well as an overview of common errors and how to fix them.

Start by learning [how our error responses are formatted](format.md), or browse the lists of possible error types in the sidebar to the left.

> For errors that are specific to a single API, more info can be found in that API's documentation space.
