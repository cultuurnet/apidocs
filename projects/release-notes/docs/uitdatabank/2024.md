# 2024 Deployments

## February 15

âœ¨ **New features**

For every event, place & organizer created in UiTdatabank we now store its `completeness`. The completeness score is a number between 0 and 100 that indicates how complete the information of an event, place or organizer is.

* Using the [avanced query field completeness](https://docs.publiq.be/docs/uitdatabank/search-api%2Fadvanced-queries#completeness) you can filter events, places and organizers by their completeness score.
* Using the [sort parameter completeness](https://docs.publiq.be/docs/uitdatabank/search-api%2Fsorting#completeness) you can now sort data you retrieve from the API by its completeness.
