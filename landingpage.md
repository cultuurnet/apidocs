# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to publiq's API documentation portal!

Here you can find how-to guides, API specifications and other tools to help you integrate with our products like UiTdatabank, UiTPAS and museumPASSmusÃ©es.

To learn more about publiq and our products, see <https://www.publiq.be>

## Getting started

If you want to build an API integration:

1. Check out the introduction pages of the [UiTdatabank](https://docs.publiq.be/docs/uitdatabank), [UiTPAS](https://docs.publiq.be/docs/uitpas) and [museumPASSmusÃ©es](https://docs.publiq.be/docs/museumpassmusees) APIs to see which ones you'd like to integrate with.
2. [Register your project](https://docs.publiq.be/docs/authentication/requesting-credentials) to receive client credentials to authenticate with.
3. [Learn about our different authentication methods](https://docs.publiq.be/docs/authentication/methods/overview) and pick the one best suited to your situation.
4. Browse the how-to guides and API specifications of the product that you're integrating with. Every API also has an **OpenAPI file** and a **Postman collection** to get you started quickly.
5. Get building!

Alternatively, check out our flexible plug and play [Widgets](https://docs.publiq.be/docs/widgets) to easily add an online calendar to your website without building an API integration.
